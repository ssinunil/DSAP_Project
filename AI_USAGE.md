# AI Usage Statement

Throughout this project, I used Claude AI (Anthropic) as an assistance tool to support various aspects of the development process. The AI was primarily used in the following ways:

## Code development assistance
Claude AI helped me write certain segments of code, particularly for data preprocessing functions, feature engineering, visualization scripts, and hyperparameter choices. The AI provided me with suggestions and code examples, which I then adapted and integrated into my project architecture. I reviewed, tested, and modified all the code to ensure that it met the project requirements and functioned correctly throughout the pipeline.

## Debugging assistance
When I encountered errors or unexpected behavior (such as initial multicollinearity issues with tree-based models), I used Claude AI to help me identify potential causes and suggest debugging strategies. The AI helped me understand the error messages and propose solutions, which I then implemented and validated through testing.

## Latex and Python assistance
Claude AI also helped me understand Latex and Python languages by helping me use the correct standards.

It is important to note that, although Claude AI was a valuable assistance tool, all strategic decisions, model choices, interpretations of results, and final implementations were made independently by me.
